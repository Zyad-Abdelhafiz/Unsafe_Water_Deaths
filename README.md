As unsafe water causes the death of about a million people every year and is one of the biggest environmental problems in the world. As polluted water is a factor in the spread of infectious diseases.

## Sustainable development goals

Based on the global goals that were published on the "kureselamaclar.org" website, which aims to achieve 17 goals in the next ten years in all countries and for all people.
I have chosen Goal No. 6 "CLEAN WATER", which mainly aims to secure drinking water for all people in an equitable manner and at a low cost by 2030.
To contribute to solving this problem, a data set was sought to present the danger that people suffer from and how unsafe water leads to the death of about 1.2 million people annually.

## Modeling, Algorithm Selection and Modeling

- Random Forest Regressor: very accurate (large datasets), overfitting less chance
- linear regression: Easy to use, using with very large datasets, getting good accuracy even if the data is not clean.
- pipeline: handle large datasets.
- Decision Tree Regressor: fast to be trained, handle large dataset.
- Gradient boosting regressor: fast to be trained, stable with big data sets.
